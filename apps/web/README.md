# @ginetta-becoding/web

This is the web app for the Ginetta BeCoding project. It's not finished yet - but is aimed to be simple app for discovering GitHub users and their public repositories.

It's a play on the "BeReal" app by serving a similar purpose, but for coders, by showing the repositories they last updated.


## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Production

```bash
pnpm build
```
